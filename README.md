## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([core](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/pokemon_go/tree/master/core), [shared](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/pokemon_go/tree/master/shared), [ui](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/pokemon_go/tree/master/lib/ui) modules).
You can do self-study about it in [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a).

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core                   # Name of module (new package)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bloc               # Business logic component.
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ network            # Remote Data Handlers
    |       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api            # Http request to get the data from the internet.
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model          # Model / POJO.

        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils          # Utility classes.
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widget             # Custom widget which can be used repeatedly.


## Built With üõ†
* [BLoC Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/) - Business logic component to separate the business logic with UI.
* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator.
* [Http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) - A type-safe HTTP client.
* [Modularization](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) - Separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules.
* [Integration Testing](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction) - Automating UI/Integration Tests.
* Handle State - (Loading, No Data, Has Data, No Internet Connection, Request Timeout, Error) using try - catch


## How to run the Test
### Integration Testing
```console
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```
