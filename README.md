## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([core](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/core), [shared](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/shared), [ui](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieCatalogue/tree/master/lib/ui) modules).
You can do self-study about it in [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a).
